During training, the amount of attention increases and the accuracy and speed of memorization improves; increases the duration of information storage and noise immunity. Such skills can be useful in consciously remembering something in everyday life in a time-limited environment. For example, driving theory, speech for public speaking, remembering the names of strangers during business acquaintances or the necessary information at conferences, etc.",
